# Startup Progress Tracker App README

Welcome to the Startup Progress Tracker app! This app serves as your comprehensive solution for recording and managing the various steps involved in the progress of your startup. Whether you're just beginning or well on your way, this app will help you stay organized and informed. Below, we've outlined essential information to get you started:

## Features

- **Step Recording:** The app provides a seamless process for recording each step of your startup journey. From initial ideation to product launch and beyond, you can easily log every milestone.

- **Local Storage:** All data related to your startup progress is securely stored using Local Storage. The designated key for this storage is `OAKS_LABS_STORAGE_KEY`, ensuring your data remains easily accessible and private.

- **Customization:** Want to tailor the app to your specific startup workflow? No problem! Head over to the `src/consts.ts` file to modify the `DEFAULT_MILESTONES` array. This empowers you to adapt the default steps to align with your unique business trajectory.

- **Reset Functionality:** Need a fresh start? To reset the app's state, simply remove the current state stored in Local Storage. This action will enable you to begin anew, refining your approach and redefining your milestones as needed.

- **Intuitive Progress Tracking:** The app simplifies progress tracking. Each step can be marked as complete once all preceding steps are finished. Additionally, if you find the need to backtrack, undoing a step will automatically reverse all subsequent steps associated with it.

- **Celebratory Notifications:** As you achieve milestones, the app rewards you with a touch of motivation. Upon completing a milestone, a toast notification will pop up, accompanied by intriguing and random startup-related facts. This not only recognizes your achievements but also keeps you engaged and entertained.
